Wang: wangc90@cczu.edu.cn  Abstract : Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a breakthrough  technology that has been widely applied in many fields and its use in pharmacy is also gaining increasing attentions. Recently, ChatGPT, a newly devel oped virtual assistant and large language model, is showing strong ability in writing, which makes it a potential tool for r eview writing. Here in our study, we employ the public available ChatGPT and try to instruct it to generate  a mini review on the top ic of “lipid- based drug delivery systems” by conversation. Our results showed that ChatGPT can give reasonable outline for this topic and give seemingly sentences with concluding wording, which can give useful information to the readers. However, the accur acy and consistence of the review are  not fully guaranteed and there is lack of reliable citations. Therefore, it is concluded that ChatGPT can only give general knowledge on the selected topic, but not capable of giving in -depth discussion. The generated r eview article can be a useful but occasionally  unprecise electronic encyclopedia instead of rigorous scientific lit-erature , which can give benefit for pharmaceutical education and interchange to some extent.       Keywords:  ChatGPT; pharmacy; review; artificial intelligence   Introduction  Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision -making, and natural language processing. [1-3] AI systems use techniques like machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to process and an-alyze large amounts of data and identify patterns or trends. [4, 5] The ultimate goal of AI is to create intelligent machines that can learn, reason, and perform  complex tasks on their own, without the need for explicit programming, which makes it a powerful assistant to human. [6] The rapid development of AI technologies is giving continuous revolution on our knowledge. After AlphaGo dominated the game of Go, the  unlimited potential of AI quickly led to its application in many different fields, such as computational diagnosis in medicine , [7] smart production in industry, [8] supply chain management in business, [9] etc.  Artificial intelligence is also gaining in creasing attention s and wider application s in pharmacy [10] It was expected that AI can greatly accelerate drug discovery and develop-ment to reduce lifecycle of pharmaceutical products. [11] Therefore, introduction of AI into pharmacy holds great potential to accelerate the drug discovery and development pro-cess, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes. [12] While most of the attention are  paid on how to use AI for the experimental, clinical or industrial development s, it is also im-portant to note that t here are also increasing needs for education and interchange, which requires AI to have strong ability in writing and communication.

            "2 of 7   Recently, a virtual assistant and large language model called ChatGPT has been de-veloped by OpenAI and made available to t he public. [13] Benefit form machine learning technology, ChatGPT can autonomously learns from massive data set of text  and improve its performance over time without being explicitly programmed. [14] ChatGPT can produce sophisticated and seemingly intelligent writing after training and keep updating to re-cently provided information. [15] Due to the strong writing ability, ChatGPT has been shown to capable of writing sophisticated and seemingly essays and talks, summarize literature and even generate computer code. [16] The use of ChatGPT also has been success-fully practiced by scientist across the globe [17-19] and we believe that its widespread to all fields is unstoppable. Therefore, it is curious for the authors to know that how can  ChatGPT benefit the fi eld of pharmacy.  Review article is a type of academic article that provides an overview and evaluation of existing research on a particular topic. The purpose of a review article is to summarize the findings from multiple studies and to provide a comprehe nsive and critical analysis of the research in a specific field. It can be a useful tool for a beginner to quickly get famil-iar with a field  and is perfectly  suitable for education and interchange purposes. Consid-ering the strong ability of ChaGPT in writi ng, we believe that review article is a good experiment subject  to test its capability on benefiting pharmacy. [20] In this study, we used the public available ChatGPT as a tool to generate a r eview article on the topic of “lipid -based drug delivery systems” by conversation. The ChatGPT was firstly asked to give a concise outline on this topic, and then required to give  more scientific information the subtitles based on the given outline.  2. Materials and methods  A review draft based on the topic of “lipid -based drug delivery systems” was gener-ated using ChatGPT ( https: //chat.openai.com/ , ChatGPT Feb 13 Version). The  history of questions (raised by the author) and  responses (produced by ChatGPT) were supplied  as Supporting Information. The reliability of ChatGPT in writing review article  was evalu-ated by comparing the ChatGPT -generated review  to peer- reviewed research and review papers on the same topic.  3. Results and Discussion  In this study, ChatGPT was asked to write the paragraph based on our questions. As shown in the  detailed conversation in the S upporting Informat ion, in our first attempt, we tried to instruct ChatGPT to list a concise outline for a scientific mini review article relating on the topic \"lipid -based drug delivery systems\" and then write a corresponding scientific review article based on the above out line with detailed examples. As instructed, ChatGPT can give reasonable outline for the selected topic and write accordingly based on it. How-ever, due to the length limitation of this ChatGPT version, the given words are restricted below 600 (also proved b y the response in the question: “Please provide scientific infor-mation on “ Applications of lipid -based drug delivery systems”  based on the outline you give with detailed examples”), which makes it impossible to write a decent mini review article in a direc t way . Therefore, in the following questions, we have to change another way by asking ChatGPT only one question related to one small subtitle in order to give full information.  As we analyze d the review draft  given by ChatGPT, we can find two obvious char-acter istics: 1) the wording is conclusive and too general without specific samples adhere to the topic;  2) lack of citations. The first characteristic might due to the reason that ChatGPT can not fully understand the requirement of the author, which can be impr oved to some extent with step -by-step conversation until reaching a consensus. However, the\n",

In another att empt, we tried to instruct ChatGPT to give specific references based on the given information with the following questions:  “Please list the references for the examples of chemotherapeutic agents that have been delivered using lipid nanoparticles for cance r treatment”, we received the following an-swer: “Certainly!

Annals of Oncology, 18(12), 2003- 2009. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further question.” (data not shown). After double check the accuracy of the  given references usin g Google Scholar, we can not identify reference 3 and 4, which means ChatGPT reach  this answer  without truly  assessing to the article but merely relayed from other sources. Moreover, we can not rule out the possibilities that ChatGPT might fabricate the re ferences by suturing different pieces of information, which deserves to be further evaluated by future studies. Moreover, the given samples in references 1 and 2 do not math the question, as the carriers for Gen-exol PM, albumin -bound paclitaxel and polyeth ylated castor oil- based paclitaxel are all out of the generally recognized scope of lipid  carriers . [21] Next, we performed more detailed evaluation on this review from two aspects: 1) structure of the outline and 2) the accuracy of the content s. In genera l, the given outline is acceptable as it is somehow reasonable. However, it was also noted that there are still some flaws. For example, in section II (Types of lipid -based drug delivery systems), lipo-somes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured  lipid carriers (NLCs) and lipid -based microemulsions as four most widely adopted kinds are involved, while lipid -drug conjugate, which represents another important specie of lipid- based drug delivery sys-tems, are neglected. [22-24]. Moreover, in section I V (Applications of lipid -based drug deliv-ery systems), cancer therapy, treatment of neurological disorders and delivery of vaccines are listed as equal subtitles. However, as far as we are concerned, cancer and neurological disorders are applications from the perspective of diseases while the delivery of vaccines are application from the perspective of drugs, which are not fully equivalent. The best solution is to divide this subtitle into two aspects as diseases and drug, and filled the cor-responding appli cations with detailed examples.

            "4 of 7   For example, a liposomal formulation of the anti -cancer drug irinotecan (Onivyde) has been developed, which can target cancer cells that overexpress the folate receptor.  Onivyde is a commercially available PEGlated liposome which does not have additional conjugation of targeting ligands. [25, 26] It was reported by previous studies that Onivyde has shown little efficacy when administered alone. [27] Therefore, in clinical practice, Onivyde usually administered intravenously in combination with 5 -fluorouracil and folic acid as for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. [28] Since folic acid is usually appear with Onivyde, ChatGPT might mistakenly think that Onivyde i s modified with folic acid and finally give the wrong conclusion of its targeting ability towards cancer cells that overexpress the folate receptor.   For example, a liposomal formulation of the MRI contrast agent gadolinium (Gd- DO3A- BSA) has been developed, which can target the lymphatic system and improve lymph node imaging.   The corrected spelling for the word “Gd- DO3A- BSA” should be “Gd -DOTA- BSA”. [29, 30] Liposomal formulations of drugs such as doxorubicin (Doxil/Caelyx) and paclitaxel (Abraxa ne) have been approved for the treatment of several types of cancer, and other LBDDS are being developed for targeted delivery of chemotherapy agents and other cancer therapies.  Abraxane is albumin -bound particle form of paclitaxel, which does not fall in the scope of liposomal formulations. [31, 32]  An example of the application of LBDDS in cancer therapy is the liposomal formulation of paclitaxel, known as Abraxane. Abraxane i s designed to encapsulate paclitaxel in a liposomal carrier, which improves its solubility and bioavailability, as well as its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution.   Abraxane is albumin -bound particle form of paclitaxel, which does not fall in the scope of  liposomal formulations. [31, 32]  Moreover, there are also some improper use s of examples which are commented in Table 2 . Table 2 . Comments of improper use of examples  Contents provided by ChatGPT  Comments by authors  Additionally, LBDDS can improve drug absorption and bioavailability by increasing their residence time in the gastrointestinal tract, promoting their uptake by enterocytes, and bypassing efflux transporters. For example, a liposomal formulation of the anti -fungal drug amphoterici n B (AmBisome) has been developed, which has higher efficacy and lower toxicity than the free drug.   AmBisome is generally administered by intravenous injection, which makes it an improper example for description related to oral administration. [33-35]  Vaccines: LBDDS have shown promise as delivery systems for vaccines, due to their ability to enhance the immune response and induce long- lasting immunity. Lipid -based carriers can encapsulate antigens and adjuvants, which can stimulate the immune system an d enhance the efficacy of vaccines. Lipid -based adjuvants such as MF59 and AS03 have been approved for use in influenza vaccines, and other LBDDS are being developed for the delivery of vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.  In the context, it s ays “LBDDS have shown promise as delivery systems for vaccines” which means LBDDS should be the carrier but not just adjuvants.  Therefore, the authors believe that the example using MF80 and AS03 is not appropriate while the delivery of mRNA for the vacci nation of COVID -19 is much more suitable.

            "5 of 7   In answer for the question: “Please provide a  concise outline for a scientific mini review article relating to the topic “lipid -based drug delivery systems””  … II. Types of lipid -based drug delivery systems  Liposomes  Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs)  Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs)  Lipid -based mi croemulsions  Comparison of the different types of systems in terms of drug loading, stability, and release  …  In answer for the question: “Please provide scientific information on “Types of lipid -based drug delivery systems” based on the outline you give above with detailed examples” Liposomes: ….  Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs): ….  Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs): ….  Lipid -drug conjugates: ….   We can see that ChatGPT is not able to fully understand what is going on and keep tract on the same topic. It seems that ChatGPT generates the answer after a series of complicated computations based on the current input without or give little attention to the previous existed information, as long as the given answer falls within the scope of the question. This is proved by the fact that if you ask ChatGPT the same question two times, you may receive different or  sometimes even controversial , answers.   In conclusion, lipid -based drug delivery systems (LBDDS) have emerged as a promising option for the delivery of a wide range of therapeutic agents, including small molecules, peptides , and nucleic acids. LBDDS offer several advantages over conventional drug delivery systems, including improved bioavailability, reduced toxicity, and the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs.  In the review draft provided by ChatGPT, no related information have been mentioned which makes it inconsistent with previous information.  4. Conclusion  In conclusion, here in our study, we employ ed the public available ChatGPT and tried to instruct it to generate a mini review on the topic of “lipid -based drug delivery systems” by conversation. ChatGPT can give a considerable amount of content s on this topic, but is unable to draft a complete scientific review due to the word restrictions. After carefully study th e outline and contents of the r eview draft produced by ChatGPT, we found the following shortages: 1) Conclusive wording which is too general and not spe-cific enough to the topic; 2) Lack of literature citations; 3) Existence of fundamental mis-takes and eve n potential suturing of information for misleading; 4) Improper use of ex-amples; 5) Inconsistence among the draft without strong logic. Based on the above rea-sons, we can conclude that it is insufficient for ChatGPT  to write  a rigorous scientific re-view bu t more suitable to be a useful tool as e lectronic encyclopedia , which can also give some benefit for pharmaceutical education and interchange.
